\title{Hue color data}
\description{
An observational study conducted in the Vegetable Production Department
at "Luiz de Queiroz" College of Agriculture/University of São Paulo in
2010/2011 to evaluate the peel color of 20 papaya cv. Sunrise Solo over
time. The color hue was measured on equatorial region of each fruit
using four points observed by the colorimeter and 1,000 points observed
by the scanner. Thus, the circular mean hue was calculated for each
fruit by device at time \eqn{t}. The aim of the agreement study was
assess how well the colorimeter agree with scanner over time.
