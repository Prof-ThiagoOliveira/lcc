\title{Internal Function to Compute the Sampled Concordance
  Correlation Values.}
\usage{
CCC(Y1, Y2)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y1}{A numeric vector.}

\item{Y2}{A numeric vector, typically paired with Y1.}
}
\value{
The concordance correlation coefficient between Y1 and Y2.
}
\description{
This function computes the sampled concordance correlation
  coefficient (CCC) between two numeric vectors. It is used internally
  for statistical analysis.
