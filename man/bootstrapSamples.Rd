  components.}
\arguments{
\item{boot.scheme}{character indicating the bootstrap resampling
scheme; defaults to "np_case" (subject-level case bootstrap). Other
options:
\itemize{
  \item "np_case": resample subjects with replacement; keep original responses.
  \item "np_case_resid_gr": case bootstrap; replace response by fitted values plus residuals sampled from the pooled residuals.
  \item "np_case_resid_ir": case bootstrap; replace response by fitted values plus residuals sampled within each subject.
  \item "np_re_resid_gr": resample subject-specific fitted trajectories (includes random effects); add residuals sampled from the pooled residuals.
  \item "np_re_resid_ir": resample subject-specific fitted trajectories; add residuals resampled within each subject.
  \item "sp_case_pr": semiparametric case bootstrap; resample subjects, use their fitted trajectories, then add Gaussian noise with variance equal to the estimated residual variance.
  \item "p_re_pr": fully parametric; simulate random effects from the estimated covariance and residuals from Gaussian noise, then generate responses via X beta + Z u + eps.

This is an internally called functions used to estimate
  fixed effects and variance components for each bootstrap sample.
