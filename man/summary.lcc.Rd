\title{Summarize an \code{lcc} Object}
\usage{
\method{summary}{lcc}(object, type, adjustSigma, verbose, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object inheriting from class
\code{\link[lcc]{lcc}}, representing a fitted longitudinal
concordance correlation function.}

\item{type}{an optional character string specifying the type of
output to be returned. If \code{type="model"}, prints the summary
of the polynomial mixed-effects regression model. If
\code{type="lcc"}, prints the summary of the fitted and sampled
values for LCC, LPC, and LA as well as the concordance correlation
coefficient between fitted values from the model and observed
values as goodness of fit (gof) measurement. Defaults to
\code{type="model"}.}

\item{adjustSigma}{an optional logical value used when \code{type =
model}. If TRUE and the estimation method used to obtain object
was maximum likelihood, the residual standard error is multiplied
by \code{sqrt(nobs/(nobs - npar))}.  See
\code{\link[nlme]{summary.lme}} for more information.  Default is
TRUE.}

\item{verbose}{an optional logical value used to control the amount
of output in the \code{print.summary.lme} method when
\code{type = model} is used. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{...}{not used.}
}
\value{
an object inheriting from class \code{summary.lcc}
  including: \item{fitted}{the fitted metric summaries extracted from
  the \code{lcc} object; returns a single data frame for
  \code{ldb = 1} or a list of data frames otherwise.}
  \item{sampled}{empirical concordance summaries on the sampled time
  grid, matching the shape of \code{fitted}.}
  \item{gof}{goodness-of-fit measurement computed as the concordance
  correlation coefficient between fitted and observed values. Value of
  1 denotes perfect concordance.}
  \item{comp}{character vector or list describing the method
  comparisons.}
  \item{info}{auxiliary information mirroring \code{plot_info},
  including \code{metrics} bundles with \code{estimate},
  \code{bootstrap}, \code{ci}, and \code{grid} entries.}
  \item{AIC}{the Akaike Information Criterion corresponding to the
  fitted model.}
  \item{BIC}{the Bayesian Information Criterion corresponding to the
  fitted model.}
  \item{logLik}{If \code{REML = FALSE}, returns the log-likelihood
  value of the linear mixed-effects model; otherwise, the restricted
  log-likelihood is returned.}
}
\description{
Additional information about the fit of longitudinal
  concordance correlation, longitudinal Pearson correlation, and
  longitudinal accuracy represented by an object of class
  \code{\link[lcc]{lcc}}. The returned object has a
  \code{\link[base]{print}} method.
}
\details{
When the original fit involves multiple method comparisons
  (\code{ldb > 1}), the \code{fitted} and \code{sampled} components
  are returned as lists with one data frame per comparison. Each data
  frame retains the time grid used in the analysis and, when confidence
  intervals are requested, includes \code{Lower}/\code{Upper} columns
  derived from the underlying metric bundle. Degenerate settings may
  yield \code{NA} estimates; confidence intervals from bootstrap
  samples can also return \code{NA} when few successful replicates are
  available or under severe heteroscedasticity.
